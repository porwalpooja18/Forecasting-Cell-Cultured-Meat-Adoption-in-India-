# Forecasting-Cell-Cultured-Meat-Adoption-in-India-

This project explores the adoption dynamics of cell-cultured meat in India, aiming to replace traditional poultry meat with lab-grown alternatives by 2050. The analysis leverages historical data on population, GDP, and poultry meat consumption to forecast future meat demand and evaluate the transition potential.

## Key Features

- Forecasting Meat Demand: Conducted in-depth analysis using Elastic Net Regression, achieving an R² score of 0.95.

- Adoption Modeling: Applied a logistic model to evaluate transition feasibility from traditional poultry to cell-cultured meat.

- Projections: Predicted adoption rates and replacement feasibility over time.

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset

The project utilizes historical data on: Population trends, GDP growth, Poultry meat consumption patterns etc in India


## Results

- Elastic Net Regression: Achieved a high R² score of 0.95 for forecasting future meat demand.

- Logistic Model: Projected transition rates to cell-cultured meat adoption, providing insights into replacement feasibility.

- Visualizations: Generated insightful graphs depicting historical trends and future projections.


## Future Work

- Extend the analysis to other types of meats (e.g., beef, pork).

- Incorporate additional socioeconomic factors (e.g., education, dietary preferences).

- Explore policy impacts on adoption rates.
